# Models Folder

This folder will contain the trained machine learning models after running the scripts:

- `model.pkl` - Trained Random Forest classifier
- `scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler for preprocessing
- `model_info.json` - Model metadata and performance metrics

These files are generated automatically by the `03_train_model.py` script.
